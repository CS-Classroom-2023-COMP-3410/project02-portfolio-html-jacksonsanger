# Reflection on My Development Process

## Development Process

To start this project, I brainstormed the theme I wanted for my website. I decided on a programming portfolio to showcase my technical skills and creative projects. Once I had the theme, I had to figure out what the two additional pages I wanted to include were. 

One of the biggest challenges I faced was figuring out the additional pages. It took me some time to figure out what I wanted the directory structure to be and which pieces of my portfolio made sense to have an image associated with it.

Another challenge was setting up the SFTP connection to the Linux server. At first, it was confusing, but I eventually figured it out by using a VS Code extension. I set up a `.sftp.json` file so that any changes I made would automatically sync to the server, which made things much easier.

Overall, I would say I learned a lot about HTML in this project.
